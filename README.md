# Terminal_Webpage
Welcome to my personal webpage!!!!!!!. 

We all know those boring 'Personal Websites' where users go and search for the url etc... 

Well I'm here to spice things up, by creating a terminal webpage where not only anyone can access, but any true developer will be able to run it in their terminal as a cli

## Running the Program
1. Download the git project
2. Run make main 
3. Enjoy the program
## ðŸš¨ NOTE

Make sure that ncurser is installed onto the system if trying to run the program
