# Terminal_Webpage
Welcome to my personal webpage!!!!!!!. 

We all know those boring 'Personal Websites' where users go and search for the url etc... 

Well I'm here to spice things up, by creating a terminal webpage where not only anyone can access, but any true developer will be able to run it in their terminal.

## Running the Program
- run 'ssh valentino.info'
